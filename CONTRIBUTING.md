## Contributing Guidelines

When submitting a pull request (PR):
* Try to solve the concrete problem at hand with as few lines of code changed as possible, while still keeping the proposal readable and easy to understand.
* Don't bundle changes in the same PR if they can be submitted in separate PR's.
* Keep enhancements separate from refactoring/cleanup changes. Those should be submitted in separate PR's.
* Code in a way that blends in with the existing code. Submit a separate PR on changing the coding style if you want to change it.

Smaller is better when submitting PR's. Dividing changes into many small PR's simplify review, reduces risk of accidental regressions and speeds up integration.
